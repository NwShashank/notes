******Coding is a way to communicate with computers by writing instructions that tell them what to do
it can be done via some language python,c,c++,java etc

HARDWARE - physical component you see and touch keyboard,monitor,modules

SOFTWARE - set of instruction given to device to perform specific task


PYTHON
Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and analyze data.


---------FEATURE

üëåüèª For learning it is easy and to use: Python is easy to learn and use, even for beginners. The syntax is plain and 
straightforward, almost like writing in English.

Object-oriented: Python is an object-oriented programming language that has highlights such as code reusability and
 measured quality. It supports highlights such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
 
üíª Interpreted: Python is an interpreted language, which implies line by line the code is executed. This makes the 
process faster and more efficient as it eliminates the need for a compilation step, and if some error occurs, it will
 not wait for the whole code to compile. It will throw an error at that particular line itself.

üåé Cross-platform: Python has the capability to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Unix.
 This makes it highly portable, allowing developers to write code on one platform and run it on another.

Extensive standard library: Python has an extensive standard library that contains modules for many everyday tasks, 
e.g. file input/output, regular expressions and networks. This reduces the code developers have to write and saves time 
and effort.
üî• Dynamically typed: Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. We don't have to 
tell the data type of the variable explicitly. This makes the language more flexible and adaptable to changing 
requirements.

High-level language: Python may be a high-level language, meaning that it abstracts absent numerous of the low-level 
points of interest of computer hardware. This permits designers to focus on the problem they are attempting to unravel, 
instead of the usage points of interest.

Support for numerous programming ideal models: Python supports numerous programming standards, counting procedural,
 functional and object-oriented programming. This makes it exceedingly versatile to distinctive coding styles and extend
  necessities.

Free and open source: The Python programming language is free and open source, which suggests it can be utilized on any 
working framework for complimentary. You'll be able download Python and the related libraries and documentation from the 
official Python site. In expansion to downloading, you'll too make and convey your possess modules or libraries.

üîç Extensive feature: The Python programming language can be extended and is more versatile than many other programming 
languages. Its adaptability to various functionalities makes Python a universal programming language in the software development 
industry. Code written in different programming languages can be executed. Python gains new capabilities and functionality by 
integrating code from other programming languages.

Database support: Python provides robust support for working with databases through its standard library and third-party packages such 
as SQLite3, MySQL Connector, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and MongoDB. Python also supports Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks such
 as Django ORM and SQLAlchemy, which provide an abstraction layer on top of databases, making it easier to work with data in object-oriented
  Python code.
  
üé® GUI Programming Support: Python provides several GUI programming frameworks and libraries, including Tkinter, PyQt, and wxPython where.
 Tkinter is a standard GUI toolkit included in Python. PyQt delivers a powerful and flexible toolkit for creating cross-platform desktop
  GUI applications, and wxPython provides a native look and feels for desktop GUI applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

-----------USES
Web development: üåê Django, Flask, and Pyramid are popular web frameworks in Python, used for building applications
 ranging from small websites to large enterprise applications. 

Data science and analytics: üìä Python is a highly demanded language in data science and machine learning, with popular
 libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and ML. 

Scientific computing: üî¨ Python is widely used in scientific computing, with modules for numerical calculations, optimization,
 linear algebra, interpolation, and special functions. Libraries like SciPy and NumPy provide a powerful way to perform 
 scientific computations.

Automation and scripting: Python is extensively used for automation tasks, such as scripting, testing, and deployment,
 providing an efficient way to automate repetitive tasks and integrate systems and services. 

Desktop GUI applications: üíª Python provides several GUI toolkits like Tkinter, PyQt, and wxPython, allowing developers to
 create desktop applications with a native look and feel. 

Game development: üéÆ Python can be used to develop games with libraries like Pygame, which provides graphics, sound,
 and input handling tools for game development. 

Networking: üåê Python has robust networking libraries, such as sockets and Requests, which make it easy to create 
network-based applications, such as web scrapers and web crawlers.

Education: üéì Python's simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for introductory programming courses in 
academia and online. 

DevOps: üöÄ Python is used extensively in the DevOps community for tasks such as automation, infrastructure management,
 and deployment. Tools such as Ansible and SaltStack are written in Python. 
 
Finance: üí∞ Python is widely used for quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, and risk management. Banks such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs use Python for financial modeling and analysis.
Healthcare: ü©∫ Python is used for medical imaging, data analysis, and research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) uses Python for genomic data analysis.
